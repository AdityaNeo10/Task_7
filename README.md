# Task_7
Task 7 â€“ Created SQL views for data abstraction, reporting, and security using an e-commerce database schema.
This task was focused on creating and using SQL Views to demonstrate data abstraction, simplify complex queries, and enhance security and reusability.

 Tools Used
MySQL Workbench

SQL (MySQL syntax)

 What I Did
Using the existing ecommerce_db schema, I created several views to:

Simplify commonly used queries

Summarize payment and order data

Hide sensitive information (like passwords)

Provide readable product stock statuses

Improve report-building efficiency

 Files Included
task7_views.sql: Full SQL script including all view definitions and example usage queries

(Optional) Screenshots of outputs from view executions in MySQL Workbench

ProductInventory	Shows stock levels of products with human-readable status labels
OrderPayments	Summarizes total payments made per order with customer details
